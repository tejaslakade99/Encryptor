The main objective of the JAVA Project on Encryption / Decryption System is to
encrypt the data of simple text files and helps Encryption /Decryption helps to hide the data important to another form using AES algorithm. The Encryption / Decryption System to an easy manner which is systematic, modular designed, selection-based user display. The project is totally built for protect the data in text file from another person.
It is based on the concept of hiding the data from other person. The user can encrypt the data as well as decrypt the data.
AES Algorithm:
AES is one of those acronyms that you see popping up everywhere. Thatâ€™s because it has become the global standard of encryption and it is used to keep a significant amount of our communications safe. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a fast and secure form of encryption that keeps prying eyes away from our data. We see it in messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal, programs like VeraCrypt and WinZip, in a range of hardware and a variety of other technologies that we use all of the time.
